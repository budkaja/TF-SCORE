# TF-SCORE

TF-SCORE is a command-line tool that can be used for the identification of over-represented transcription factor binding patterns within a gene list of interest. This program utilizes open chromatin information to map potential transcription factor binding sites with the help of position weight matrices (PWMs). The use of open chromatin data decreases the false positive rate of PWMs and allows for cell-type specific identification of the cis-regulatory elements near the provided gene set.
